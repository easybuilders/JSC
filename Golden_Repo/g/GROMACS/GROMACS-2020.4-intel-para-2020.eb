name = 'GROMACS'
version = '2020.4'

homepage = 'http://www.gromacs.org'
description = """
GROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate the Newtonian equations
of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of particles. It is primarily designed for
biochemical molecules like proteins and lipids that have a lot of complicated bonded interactions,
but since GROMACS is extremely fast at calculating the non-bonded interactions (that usually
dominate simulations) many groups are also using it for research on non-biological systems, e.g.
polymers.

Documentation
=============
Use `gmx` to execute GROMACS commands on a single node, for example, to prepare your run. Use
`gmx_mpi mdrun` in your job scripts with `srun`. The user documentation of GROMACS can be found at
http://manual.gromacs.org/documentation/current/user-guide/index.html.
