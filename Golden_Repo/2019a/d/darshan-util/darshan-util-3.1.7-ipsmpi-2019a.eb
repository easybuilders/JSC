description = """Darshan is designed to capture an accurate picture of
application I/O behavior, including properties such as patterns of
access within files, with minimum overhead.  The name is taken from a
Sanskrit word for “sight” or “vision”.

Darshan can be used to investigate and tune the I/O behavior of
complex HPC applications.  In addition, Darshan’s lightweight design
makes it suitable for full time deployment for workload
characterization of large systems.  We hope that such studies will
help the storage research community to better serve the needs of
scientific computing.

Darshan was originally developed on the IBM Blue Gene series of
computers deployed at the Argonne Leadership Computing Facility, but
it is portable across a wide variety of platforms include the Cray
XE6, Cray XC30, and Linux clusters.  Darshan routinely instruments
jobs using up to 786,432 compute cores on the Mira system at ALCF.

Note:

Darshan currently only works with C or C++ codes, not with Fortran.
