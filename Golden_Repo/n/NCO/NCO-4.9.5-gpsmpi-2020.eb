description = """NCO manipulates data stored in netCDF-accessible formats,
 including HDF4 and HDF5. It also exploits the geophysical expressivity of many
 CF (Climate & Forecast) metadata conventions, the flexible description of
 physical dimensions translated by UDUnits, the network transparency of OPeNDAP,
 the storage features (e.g., compression, chunking, groups) of HDF (the
 Hierarchical Data Format), and many powerful mathematical and statistical
 algorithms of GSL (the GNU Scientific Library).
