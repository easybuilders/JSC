# Jülich Supercomputing Centre easyconfig repository

* This is the *PUBLIC* easybuild repository of JSC.
* This repository and its files are based on the upstream EasyBuild repository (https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyconfigs, https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-easyblocks and https://github.com/easybuilders/easybuild-framework), and heavily modified and extended to fit JSC's requirements.
* This repository is provided as-is. No compatibility with the upstream repository is guaranteed (actually it is almost guaranteed that you'll run into problems if you use it naïvely)
* To try to ensure that everything is working properly and avoiding collisions with the upstream easyconfigs, it is recommended to use the `--robot` and `--robot-paths` options, as set up in the `Developers/InstallSoftware-2017.lua` module. For more info take a look at http://easybuild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Using_the_EasyBuild_command_line.html#controlling-the-robot-search-path
* All credits go to the original authors (and to the maintainers) of each file, be they JSC employees or otherwise.
