Cube, which is used as performance report explorer for Scalasca and Score-P,
is a generic tool for displaying a multi-dimensional performance space
consisting of the dimensions (i) performance metric, (ii) call path, and
(iii) system resource. Each dimension can be represented as a tree, where
non-leaf nodes of the tree can be collapsed or expanded to achieve the
desired level of granularity.

This module provides the Cube graphical report explorer.
