description = """TotalView breaks down barriers to understanding what's going
 on with your high-performance computing (HPC) and supercomputing applications.
 Purpose-built for multicore and parallel computing, TotalView provides a set
 of tools providing unprecedented control over processes and thread execution,
 along with deep visibility into program states and data.

 By allowing the simultaneous debugging of many processes and threads in a
 single window, you get complete control over program execution: running,
 stepping, and halting line-by-line through code within a single thread or
 within arbitrary groups of processes or threads. You can also work backwards
 from failure through reverse debugging, isolating the root cause faster by
 eliminating the need to repeatedly restart the application, reproduce and
 troubleshoot difficult problems that can occur in concurrent programs that
 take advantage of threads, OpenMP, MPI, GPUs, or coprocessors.

 With customizable displays of the state of your running program, memory leaks,
 deadlocks, and race conditions are things of the past. Whether you're a
 scientific and technical computing veteran, or new to the development
 challenges of multicore or parallel applications, TotalView gives you the
 insight to find and correct errors quickly, validate prototypes early, verify
 calculations accurately, and above all, certify code correctly.

 TotalView works with C, C++, and Fortran applications written for Linux
 (including the Cray and Blue Gene platforms), UNIX, Mac OS X, and Xeon Phi
 coprocessor, and supports OpenMP, MPI, and OpenACC / CUDA.
